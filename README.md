# React-Weather-App

<h1> Hey Developers!
Presenting you all the 'Weather React App'  </h1>
<h2>I have made this app using React Hooks, and Openweathermap API.
The way I connected the API is quite simple  to understand for a beginner.
  <br>
We just have to enter the 'CITY NAME' and we`ll get the result of its weather along with date.
Initially, I haven't added much UI and made it simple, but soon I'll add a good sort of CSS.
  </br>

For more details checkout the source code.
Below image is the demonstration of my Weather-App. </h2>
